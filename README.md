# NavRoute plugin for EDMC

This is a simple [Elite Dangerous Market Connector][EDMC] plugin to add a handy display for your current NavRoute.

Once a route has been plotted, the display will indicate the remaining jumps as well as a configurable number of
interim jumps between your current position and final target.

If you jump to a system that is not on your route, the plugin will indicate this and suggest the next unvisited
system on the route.

## Requirements

## Installation
* Download the [latest release]
* Extract the `.zip` archive that you downloaded into the EDMC `plugins` folder
  * This is accessible via the plugins tab in the EDMC settings window
* Start or restart EDMC to register the new plugin
